Deciding whether this is the most effective tool, however, is a good deal more complicated because minimum wages 
address low-wage work, whereas poverty is based on family income. One complication is research pointing to employment
 declines from minimum wage increases (see Neumark 2015), which means raising wages for some people must be weighed
 against potential job losses for others. In this case, whether a higher minimum wage on net helps poor and
 low-income families depends on the specific pattern of employment effects for different family types.
(Neumark , 2015)

First, 57% of poor families with heads of household ages 18â€“64 have no workers, based on 2014 data from the
Current Population Survey (CPS). Second, some workers are poor not because of low wages but because of low hours;
for example, CPS data show 46% of poor workers have hourly wages above $10.10, and 36% have hourly wages above $12.
And third, many low-wage workers, such as teens, are not in poor families (Lundstrom forthcoming).
(Neumark , 2015)

the general conclusion from this literature is that there is no statistically significant relationship between
raising the minimum wage and reducing poverty

do increased wages increase productivity?
	-higher wages increase QOL which means the workers are in a better state of mind, happier, can enjoy hobbies
	less stressed, etc so in turn they are more productive. So not necessarily that higher wages inherently
	increase productivity but rather a wage that allows a person to be able to pay for their needs and have
	enough left over to enrich their leisure time would increase productivity. Granted, this correlation
	does not hold for all periods of time (see the graph around 1980 where there is a huge drop in wage growth
	but productivity does not take nearly the same hit)
	-does not necessarily need to be a wage increase directly, rather it could come in the form of some
	government subsidy that helps support low income individuals and would still have a similar effect
	-if minimum wage was increased businesses would most likely lay off inefficient workers and instead invest
	in increasing the capital of the business and as a result this would in increase the general productivity of
	each worker
