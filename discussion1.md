I do not believe this proposal by Alexandaria Ocasio Cortez is radical and if anything the evidence points to it being the best plan of action. It makes sense and is fair to ask wealthy individuals and families to such a higher tax rate because as shown by marginal prosperity to consume. Marginal prosperity to consume is defined as “…the proportion of an aggregate raise in pay that a consumer spends on the consumption of goods and services, as opposed to saving it” (Chappelow, 2020). The MPC varies based on income level and high earning individuals tend to have a lower MPC which means that they save more and lower income individuals have a higher MPC meaning that they are more likely to spend money they would receive in a raise (Chappelow, 2020). This means, if the wealthy were taxed higher they would lose some of their savings but not any of the money as they spend and if lower income individuals were taxed less as a result of the increased rate for the wealthy then they would be more likely to spend this extra money on goods and services. This also ties in to the concept of diminishing marginal utility which “…is the common-sense notion that an extra dollar is worth a lot less in satisfaction to people with very high incomes than to those with low  incomes” (Krugman, 2019). This increased tax rate will make the wealthy lose a little bit of money but it will not impact them much in comparison to the benefit a lower income individual would see. It is important however, to not over tax the wealthy because then this will disincentivize the wealthy from doing whatever they have done to make so much money and this would hurt the economy (Krugman, 2019).

To determine the optimal tax rate for high earners it is important to look at three elasticities. The first elasticity is their labor supply response (Bunker, 2019). Since higher earns are rational people thinking at the margin if taxes are increased they will evaluate the trade-offs of working and leisure. If the tax rate was increased too much then the top earners might lose the incentive to continue working and decide to stop working. As a result this would actually reduce the amount collected from the taxes and could hurt economic growth (Bunker, 2019). It was found that the top earners do not greatly change their labor supply in response to taxes (Bunker, 2019). The second elasticity is tax avoidance (Bunker 2019). Tax avoidance is when the top earners change what they receive as income so that they can avoid higher tax rates (Bunker 2019). If the tax rate is raised then top earners may feel the need to change their income to capital income to avoid the tax rate (Bunker, 2019). However, it was found that top earners in the US are not likely to shift their income to counteract tax rates (Bunker, 2019). The third elasticity is executive compensation bargaining (Bunker, 2019). If tax rates were raised then executives would be less likely to negotiate for higher pay (Bunker 2019). This was shown to have a high elasticity which could mean that the funds that would go into the higher pay of executives could be diverted to the wages of average workers (Bunker, 2019). This ties back into the concept of marginal prosperity to consume and marginal utility. These average workers are likely to feel more satisfied from this raise than the executives and they are also more likely to spend this extra money which would benefit the economy.

It is clear that this increased tax rate on the wealthy is a step in the right direction. Increasing the tax rates of the top earners in the United States would impact the economy in a positive way because the increased taxes would not change output growth and would increase the wages of the average worker (Bunker 2019).
