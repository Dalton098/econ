​	When the US economy is going into a recession usually the Fed will look to change the Federal Funds Rate. This is usually done by having the Federal Reserve print money and then buy short-term treasury securities (n.d., Khan).This causes the demand for reserves to go down and the supply for reserves to increase (n.d., Khan). In turn, this should cause the Federal Funds Rate to go down from where it is currently (n.d., Khan). The problem is, the Federal Funds Rate cannot go below zero. When the Feds Funds rate is approaching zero the normal open market operations that the Fed would take lose their effectiveness (2020, Chappelow). So what can be done when the Federal Funds Rate hits zero to help the economy? This is where Quantitative Easing comes in. Quantitative Easing is an “…unconventional monetary policy in which a central bank purchases longer-term securities from the open market in order to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment” (2020, Chappelow). The Federal Reserve usually buys longer-term government bonds and other assets such as mortgage-backed securities (2020. Chappelow).

​	During the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve turned to Quantitative Easing to help the US economy. The Fed increased the money supply by $4 trillion (2020, Chappelow). The goal of this increase in the money supply was to spur US banks to lend and invest the money to stimulate growth (2020, Chappelow). However, what actually happened did not match this goal. Banks ended up keeping a large amount of the money as excess reserves which essentially defeated the purpose of the money (2020, Chappelow). Even though the banks did not due what the Fed had intended them to do, the Quantitative Easing still helped rescue the US economy from the Great Recession (2020, Chappelow). It is hard to measure how much Quantitative Easing played a role in the following recovery of the Great Recession (2020, Chappelow). The reoccurring theme with Quantitative Easing seems to be that it does help the economy and is useful in times of economic crises. However, it is difficult to quantify the exact results that come from Quantitative Easing.
