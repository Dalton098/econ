For my final project idea I was planning to do a comparison of the Great Recession and the current economic situation due to COVID-19. Also, I was planning at looking at whether the recent events are likely to lead to a recession. If it is likely this current situation will lead to a recession then to say  whether this recession will be worse than the Great Recession.

Data Analysis and Mathematic I plan to use:

- Okunâ€™s Law using various expected levels of unemployment to determine output for each. Then using these outputs to determine an expected % output gap.
  - Compare these output gaps to the output gap seen in the Great Recession and discuss similarities and differences. What this could mean for the US economy given what we saw in the Great Recession.
- Unemployment and the Sahm rule
  - Compare this information with the Great Recessions and see if any similar patterns are showing between the two and if this could mean that the US economy will fall into another recession due to this pandemic.
- Phillips Curve
  - Graph of unemployment rate and inflation across the same time period and seeing if the surge in unemployment during the Great Recession caused a decrease in inflation. Then look at todays situation to see if it is likely that inflation will drop as well due to unemployment rising.

I would also look at Inflation Expectations. You might take a look at  the Monetary Policy response including: the Taylor Rule, the Money  Multiplier, etc. The Monetary Policy response will be crucial to  analyzing each of shocks due to the Great Recession and Covid- 19.
