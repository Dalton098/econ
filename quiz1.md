Slope for supply demand is $\frac{q}{p}$ where q is quantity and p is price

Three major markets - goods and services, asset market, labor market

Firms demand labor and workers supply labor

**Marginal product of labor** - In economics, the **marginal product of labor** (**MPL**) is the change in [output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_(economics)) that results from employing an added unit of [labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_demand).

W = MPN

**Competitive market**

1. homogenous goods
2. many buyers and sellers
3. little or no barrier to entry
4. price takers

Substitutes - coke and pepsi -> if price of coke goes up then the demand for pepsi goes up

Complements - cookies and milk -> as demand for cookies goes up so does demand for milk

**Marignal cost** -  A conventional marginal cost  is incremented by one unit; that is, it is the [cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost) of producing one more unit of a good

Production function: Y = Af(k,N)

​	Y = output/income

​	A = Total factor productive. Doing more with less

​	k = capital - machines, equipment, education

​	N = labor

factors of production (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship)

pi = TR - TC

​	profit = total returns - total cost

​	As wages go up, hire less people/fire people to keep profit

**Labor Market**

Firms are profit maximizers

individuals maximize utility -> maximize happiness

W < MPN -> hire people

W = MPN

W > MPN -> fire people/lay people off

Why does labor demand slope down?

- skilled workers leave as wage goes down
- Diminishing marginal productivity
  - As you increase N (labor) the MPN goes down 

As wage goes up labor goes up -> worker wants to get paid well

**substitution effect** - higher wage, work more

**income effect** - higher income, less work (Ex: win lottery, stop working)

**trade off** - work vs leisure

Demand shifted, labor and wage increased

What would shift labor demand curve?

- increase in capital (k) shift demand up and right, decrease would be down and to the left
- Increase in education, increases human capital and productivity (A)

**Labor demand shock**

demand -> increase in k (capital), increase in A (productivity)

positive shock -> shifts up and to the right, wages go up and employment goes up

**Labor supply shock**

Who is supply? Workers

(Below always increase)

Workers - population increase -> immigration, fertility

Wealth - > richer you are less likely to work

Working age pop -> 25-54

Expected future wage -> if wage is higher in the future, work less now

labor force participation rate: employed and unemployed but able to work

**Advantages**

**Absolute advantage** - Absolute advantage is the ability of an individual, company, region, or  country to produce a greater quantity of a good or service with the same quantity of inputs per unit of time, or to produce the same quantity of a good or service per unit of time using a lesser quantity of inputs,  than another entity that produces the same good or service. 

**Comparative advantage** - [Comparative advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/explaining-comparative-advantage/) is an economic term that refers to an economy's ability to produce  goods and services at a lower opportunity cost than that of trade  partners 

**Opportunity costs** - Opportunity costs represent the benefits an individual, investor or business *misses out on* when choosing one alternative over another. 

​	Calculate slope of the curve to determine opportunity cost

**Trade**

Does not change the production function, just allocates resources differently

**Positive statements** - Positive economics describes and explains various economic phenomena or the "what is" scenario. 

**Normative statements** - Normative economics focuses on the value of economic fairness, or what the economy "should be" or "ought to be." 

While positive economics is based on fact and cannot be approved or  disapproved, normative economics is based on value judgments.
